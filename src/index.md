# Rust by Example

[Rust][rust] is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed,
and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using 
garbage collection.

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust
concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget
to [install Rust locally][install] and check out the [official docs][std]. 
Additionally for the curious, you can also [check out the source code for this site][home].

Now let's begin!

- [Hello World](hello.md) - A traditional "Hello World!" program.

- [Primitives](primitives.md) - Signed/unsigned integers and other primitives.

- [Custom Types](custom_types.md) - Custom types using `struct` and `enum`.

- [Variable Bindings](variable_bindings.md) - Mutable bindings, scope, shadowing.

- [Types](types.md) - Casting, aliasing, and specifying types.

- [Conversion](conversion.md) - Converting between types.

- [Expressions](expression.md) -Explanation of expressions.

- [Flow of Control](flow_control.md) - `if`/`else`, `for`, and other control flow modifiers.

- [Functions](fn.md) - Methods, Closures and High Order Functions.

- [Modules](mod.md) - Modules for code organization.

- [Crates](crates.md) - Libraries and compilation units in Rust.

- [Cargo](cargo.md) - Basic features of the official Rust package management tool.

- [Attributes](attribute.md) - Metadata applied to some module, crate, or item.

- [Generics](generics.md) - Functions or data types that can work for multiple types of arguments.

- [Scoping rules](scope.md) - Scopes play an important part in ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.

- [Traits](trait.md) - A collection of methods defined for an unknown type: `Self`.

- [Macros](macros.md) - Metaprogramming in Rust.

- [Error handling](error.md) - Error handling in Rust.

- [Std library types](std.md) - A few custom types provided by the Rust `std` library.

- [Std misc](std_misc.md) - More custom types for file handling and threads.

- [Testing](testing.md) - All sorts of testing in Rust.

- [Unsafe Operations](unsafe.md) - Bypassing certain compiler protections.

- [Compatibility](compatibility.md) - Notes about compatibility concerns.

- [Meta](meta.md) - How to document and benchmark in Rust.
